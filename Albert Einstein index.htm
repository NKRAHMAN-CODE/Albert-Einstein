<!-- Paragraphs --> 
<p>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire. His family was of Jewish descent, though non-religious, and they later moved to Munich. Einstein’s early education was at the Luitpold Gymnasium (later known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium). His early school years, however, were not particularly extraordinary. He was a quiet child, often deep in thought, and showed an early fascination with mathematics and science. 

By the age of 10, Einstein had started exploring complex concepts, though his formal schooling was rigid and uninspiring. His family later moved to Italy, and he completed his secondary education at Aargau Cantonal School in Switzerland. Einstein graduated from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich in 1900 with a degree in physics. </p>

<h2> The Annus Mirabilis (Miracle Year)</h2> 
<p> 1905 was Einstein’s "Annus Mirabilis," or miracle year, during which he published four groundbreaking papers that revolutionized physics. Working at the Swiss Patent Office, he used his spare time to explore complex scientific questions. His four 1905 papers focused on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and mass-energy equivalence (E=mc²). Each of these papers laid the foundation for various branches of modern physics: 

Photoelectric Effect: This paper explained how light could eject electrons from metals, providing evidence for the quantum theory of light and later earning him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. 

Special Relativity: This theory revolutionized the way we understand space and time, showing that time and space are interwoven into a single continuum known as spacetime. 

E=mc²: Perhaps his most famous equation, this describes the relationship between mass and energy, asserting that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa. 

These papers established Einstein as one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century.</p>

<h3> General Theory of Relativity </h3> 
 

<p>In 1915, Einstein presented the General Theory of Relativity, expanding on his earlier theory of special relativity. The general theory incorporated gravity, describing it as the warping of spacetime by massive objects. This theory predicted that light would bend when passing near massive objects, a phenomenon later confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during a solar eclipse in 1919. 

This confirmation catapulted Einstein into international fame, and the theory of general relativity has since become a cornerstone of modern physics, influencing areas from cosmology to quantum mechanics.</p>

<h4>Later Life, Fame, and Political Activism </h4>  

<p>Einstein became a global icon of scientific genius after the success of his theories, touring the world and giving lectures. He received numerous honors and awards for his work. In the 1930s, with the rise of Nazism in Germany, Einstein, being Jewish, emigrated to the United States. He accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he would remain for the rest of his life.  

  

Although Einstein’s fame was largely due to his contributions to physics, he was also a vocal advocate for civil rights and pacifism. He denounced militarism, supported Zionism, and spoke out against the use of atomic weapons, especially after his theories were instrumental in developing the atomic bomb (though he did not directly participate in its creation).</p>

<h5> Daily Life Routine of Einstein </h5> 

<p> Albert Einstein's daily routine was marked by a balance of disciplined work, curiosity, and simplicity. He typically started his mornings early, engaging in deep, focused thinking and solving complex problems. Many of his scientific breakthroughs came during these early hours, when he would reflect on theoretical questions and mathematical puzzles. After his mornings of intense intellectual work, Einstein often took long walks, which he found essential for clearing his mind and stimulating creative thought. He believed that physical activity helped generate new ideas and insights. In the afternoons, he would return to work, either teaching, writing, or engaging in correspondence with other scientists. Einstein valued simplicity in his daily life, avoiding distractions, and prioritizing time for deep thinking. Even his meals were modest, allowing him to focus on the mental clarity needed for his research. His commitment to routine, combined with moments of relaxation and creativity, helped him maintain the mental energy necessary for groundbreaking discoveries. </p> 

 

 

<h6>Personal Life</h6> 

<p> Einstein’s personal life was marked by complexity. He married twice: first to Mileva Marić, a fellow physicist, with whom he had three children (though their relationship was strained and they eventually divorced), and then to his cousin Elsa Löwenthal. Einstein was known to be a solitary figure, often deeply absorbed in his work, but he was also a public intellectual, engaging in various political and humanitarian causes. 

Despite his reputation as a genius, Einstein struggled with personal relationships and could be somewhat distant in his private life, focusing intensely on his scientific work.</p> 

 

 

 

<h7>Fun Facts About Albert Einstein</h7> 

<p> Unusual Quirks 

Forgetfulness: Despite being one of the greatest minds of all time, Einstein was notoriously absent-minded. He would often forget everyday things like where he put his keys or even where he lived. He once famously walked to a neighbor’s house when he couldn’t recall his own address. 

Simple Wardrobe: Einstein preferred simplicity, especially when it came to clothing. He famously said, “If I have to be fashionable, I’d rather be unhappy.” Einstein typically wore the same kind of outfit each day, including a plain sweater and trousers. This choice was deliberate—he believed it saved him time and mental energy.  

No Socks: One of Einstein’s quirks was his disdain for socks. He found them unnecessary and a hassle, often pointing out that they tended to wear out and get holes. So, he simply didn’t wear them! Even when attending formal events, Einstein would wear his shoes without socks, much to the surprise of his hosts. 

Nobel Prize 

Not for Relativity: Despite being most famous for his theory of relativity, Einstein didn’t win the Nobel Prize for this groundbreaking work. Instead, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. This work laid the foundation for quantum mechanics and helped revolutionize the understanding of light and atomic particles. 

The photoelectric effect demonstrated that light could behave like a particle, a concept that clashed with the wave theory of light at the time. This discovery was key to the development of many modern technologies, including solar panels.  

Autopsy and Brain Study 

Posthumous Study of His Brain: When Einstein passed away in 1955, his brain was removed during the autopsy by Dr. Thomas Stoltz Harvey, the pathologist at Princeton Hospital. Although Einstein had not given permission for this, Harvey kept the brain, hoping it would provide insights into his genius. 

Over the years, sections of Einstein’s brain were studied by scientists to try to understand what made him so brilliant. Some studies claimed to find unusual features, such as a greater number of glial cells (which support neurons) and a distinct structure of the parietal lobes, which are linked to mathematical reasoning and spatial cognition.  

Brain Dissection: Harvey sliced Einstein's brain into approximately 240 pieces and preserved them in jars of formaldehyde. He sent pieces of the brain to various researchers around the world. However, these studies have been controversial, and no definitive conclusions were reached about whether these differences were directly related to Einstein’s intellectual abilities. 

Controversy: The removal and study of Einstein’s brain were highly controversial, as it went against his wishes. Einstein’s family only learned about the brain dissection later, and it became a point of ethical debate in the scientific community. </p>

        <div class="faq-item"> 

            <h2>1. What were Albert Einstein's contributions to the atomic bomb?</h2> 

            <p>Einstein did not directly work on the creation of the atomic bomb, but his scientific discoveries were indirectly related to its development. The most significant connection was his famous equation  

            <em>E = mc<sup>2</sup></em>, which showed that mass could be converted into enormous amounts of energy, laying the theoretical groundwork for nuclear power and weapons.</p> 

            <p>In 1939, Einstein, along with physicist Leo Szilard, co-signed a letter to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning him that Nazi Germany might be working on an atomic bomb. This letter played a pivotal role in the creation of the Manhattan Project, which ultimately led to the development of the atomic bomb. Although Einstein was a pacifist and later regretted the use of nuclear weapons, his early warning contributed to the start of nuclear research in the U.S.</p>

            <h2>2. What is the theory of relativity in simple terms?</h2> 

            <p>Einstein's theory of relativity consists of two parts: special relativity and general relativity.</p> 

            <p><strong>Special Relativity (1905):</strong> This theory focuses on the relationship between space and time, especially for objects moving at a constant speed in a straight line. A key insight is that the speed of light is the same for all observers, no matter how fast they are moving. This leads to some surprising conclusions: time slows down for objects moving at high speeds, and distances shorten. For example, astronauts traveling at near-light speed would experience time much slower than people on Earth—this is called time dilation.</p> 

            <p><strong>General Relativity (1915):</strong> This theory expands on special relativity and explains how gravity works. Einstein proposed that massive objects (like planets or stars) warp the fabric of space and time around them, creating the effect of gravity. Imagine space and time as a flexible sheet, and a heavy object creates a dent in it—other objects move toward that dent, which explains gravitational pull. General relativity predicted phenomena such as the bending of light around stars (gravitational lensing) and black holes, which were later confirmed by observations.</p> 

            <p>In simple terms, Einstein’s theory showed that space and time are interconnected and not fixed, and gravity is the result of how mass affects the shape of this space-time fabric.</p>

        <div class="faq-item"> 

            <h2>3. Why didn’t Einstein believe in quantum mechanics?</h2> 

            <p>Einstein had a complicated relationship with quantum mechanics, which he helped develop through his work on the photoelectric effect. While quantum mechanics became highly successful in explaining the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level, Einstein was uncomfortable with certain aspects of the theory, particularly its reliance on probability and uncertainty.</p> 

            <p><strong>Quantum Mechanics vs. Einstein’s Determinism:</strong> Quantum mechanics suggests that particles don’t have definite states until they are measured, meaning there’s inherent uncertainty (famously described by Werner Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle). Einstein, however, believed that the universe operated on clear, deterministic laws. He famously said, “God does not play dice with the universe,” rejecting the idea that fundamental processes were governed by chance.</p> 

            <p><strong>Einstein’s Objections:</strong> One of his major objections came from what’s now known as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. Einstein argued that if quantum mechanics were complete, it would allow for “spooky action at a distance” (now called quantum entanglement), where two particles could instantly affect each other, no matter how far apart they were. This idea seemed too strange and violated the principle of locality (the idea that objects are only influenced by their immediate surroundings).</p> 

            <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Although Einstein didn’t accept the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics, many of his criticisms led to deeper research and experimental verification of quantum phenomena, such as entanglement. Today, quantum mechanics is widely accepted, but Einstein’s concerns helped refine the field.</p>
